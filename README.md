# Belly Button Biodiversity Challenge - Module 14

This repository contains all of the files and code related to the Module 14 challenge, which uses HTML and JavaScript to build a site with interactive charts visualizing different bacteria and microorganisms found in various subjects' belly buttons.

The folder titled `static/js` contains the completed JavaScript file that builds the charts and organizes the data on the site. This file is titled `app.js`. The data is saved in a JSON file, titled `samples.json`, and can be found in the main repository. The HTML document for the site itself can also be found in the main repository; this file is titled `index.html`.

The starter code, which was used as the basis of this challenge, can all be found in the folder titled `Starter_Code`. The main reference here would be the file titled `app_starter.js`, which is in the subfolder titled `static_starter/js_starter`. This, along with the activities from Module 14 (especially those from days 2 and 3), helped me write the code for this challenge.

This repository is also deployed to GitHub Pages. This public site can be found here: https://williamlevine.github.io/belly-button-challenge/
